# Squares App
responsive web page with an infinite scrolling area filled with fixed squares of
size 15px by 15px. Squares are positioned 3px apart each other. The squares must be
laid out responsively to fit the defined area. Each square is filled with a randomly
generated color with drop shadow.

When a square is clicked, the square will animate by 20o rotation thus overlapping the
other squares. On the second click, the square will perform animation in reverse to
return to its original position.
